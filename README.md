# Bayesian-Networks

Bayesian network is a combination of probabilistic model and graph model. It is applied widely in machine learning, data mining, diagnosis, etc. because it has a solid evidence-based inference which is familiar to human intuition. 

Bayesian belief networks is a class of highly data efficient and interpretable models for domains with causal relationships between variables. The trade-off is a dependency on good prior knowledge and often problem-specific adaptions and simplifications. For the problems where their strengths shine however, belief networks are well worth their trouble.
This can be applied in a wide range of areas in health services research (health economic evaluation, health quality measurement, health outcomes monitoring, cost-effectiveness analysis), but also in epidemiology, clinical research, medical decision making or public health.
